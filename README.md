# FFM - my First Fabric mod

this is just a mod to learn and try some things, it might be reorganized and renamed later to make it into a real thing tho

# features

as of now it just:
 - enable blending on player inventory and chest backgrounds (to make semi transparent textures work)
 - control if texts has shadow (in Config.java, true -> always, false -> never, null -> vanilla behaviour)
 - fully changes the item tooltip to something that resembles sky.lea.moe (a skyblock stat website, replaced by sky.shiiyu.moe) ones
 - and might create a few bugs along the way !
